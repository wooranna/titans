<div>&nbsp;Two find Their True Selves
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>&nbsp;Beep beep a notification appeared on James’ phone it was from Jason Zeade, Jason had red eyes and black hair combed  forward, he wore a Gucci Kingsnake baseball cap, a Louis Vuitton Monogram circle cut hoodie, Nike Dri-Fit pants and Nike Travis Scott X Air Force 1 Cactus Jack shoes.
</div><div>“YO there’s this suspicious guy following me, he looks like a criminal, I am at block 126,”  Jason whispered.
</div><div>“'Ok meet you there,”  James messaged.
</div><div>&nbsp;Then James arrived and saw a Fat guy with a green singlet and ripped up shorts, he was holding a half drank beer bottle and he was following Jason.
</div><div>James asked the fat man what he was doing, all that came out of the fat guy was “Kill” James knew something was gonna go down, he remembered he brought his katana so he took it out and charged at the drunk guy, when Jason saw James he took out a knife and also charged at the guy, suddenly the drunk guy turned into the grim reaper and disappeared leaving a small explosion, both James and Jason got pushed back, nearly dying. 
</div><div>They woke up in a weird looking hospital, the walls were red and the floor looked like someone was shot 100 times and no one bothered to clean up the blood. James and Jason were handcuffed to the bed and James could see Jason struggling but his arms looked transparent, he looked at his whole body to see something he’s never seen before, Jason’s whole body was transparent apart from his head, His red eyes glowed like a flashlight, Mist was surrounding him like a tornado, he had a white cape and a big white spike on his head. James realized he was handcuffed too, he was struggling to get out and he was angry and confused.

<br>
<br>Randomly, a young girl walked in and told them
<br>”Crimson, Mythic, Spikeskull is looking for you guys and you need to get ready, use these weapons to protect
<br>yourself!”  Then the girl uncuffed the friends, James got up and look at the mirror, he remembered how rich he was
<br>he had a Gucci icon ring with gemstones, black chain earring, BAPE x Neighborhood Split Camo Shark Full Zip Hoodie Black and
<br>White, Supreme x Louis Vuitton 5-Panel Hat Brown, BAPE x adidas adicolor Track Pants Raw Red and Jordan 1
<br>Retro High Off-White University Blue Jordan 1s and his Gucci backpack with nature embroidery on the bed strapped on with 
<br>his katana. 
<br>The girl realized “Oh I forgot to introduce myself my name is Ava and we need to get to Mt. Titan, after a
<br>minute of shaking beds everything went silent with a tired sigh, James noticed Jason sleeping…  
<br>“DROP BEARS EVERYWHERE!”  Jason flew out of bed like he was pulled out, both Ava and James looked at Jason
<br>confused.                                                         
<br>“So uh what’s the Titan mountain thing?” Jason blushed, “This never happened.” Jason calmly announced, Ava 
<br>repeated Jason, “You will forget this moment” Jason said before Ava repeated him. James’ jaw dropped.  
<br>“How did you do that?”
<br>“I can’t tell you” exclaimed Jason
<br>“Why?” James asked
<br>“Anyways let's go to Mt.Titan” Jason said awkwardly, as he turned back into a human.
<br>So they took their stuff and went downstairs to the lobby the nurse didn’t stop them, they hopped in to 
<br>James’ Lamborghini Urus which was parked better than he could park, James took the driver seat and Ava sat 
<br>next to him and entered the address on his iphone. They drove for around 3 hours then they reached a huge 
<br>gateway they got out and went through the gate way and reached a big iron wall which surrounded the 
<br>whole mountain
<br> “ Guys your iris’ are already registered so put your eyes against that machine” explained Ava.
<br>Jason put his eyes against a microscope looking machine then big iron gates opened to a bridge built over lava, the 
<br>three crossed the bridge to the mountain.
<br>“Do you guys see that hole, put your hand in it and it will take blood sample from you using that small pin and 
<br>examine the DNA”
<br>“Pin?” Jason asked.
<br>“Yes, a pin.” Ava replied. Jason opened his eyes wide with fear.
<br>“So James this is your job man.” Jason said.
<br>Then james put his arm inside the hole and he felt pain like an ant bite, 5 seconds later, big doors open,
<br>they see a tech room with multiple gaming PCs and laptops, a war room with weapons and targets and a cinema 
<br>room with a big screen and some comfy bean bags.&nbsp;<br></p>

<div>“Wow” James exclaimed.
</div><div>“Welcome to the crib” Ava said.
</div><div>“Is this a place where I can snooze and drink some booze?” Jason asked.
</div><div>“Do what you want,” Ava replied. Jason clapped happily, while he was clapping an eski floated to him from the 
</div><div>gaming room.
</div><div>“I have a secret I need to tell you two, you guys need to keep this secret safe,” Ava whispered.
</div><div>“You guys are superhumans,” Ava whispered.
</div><div>“Great so what’s the real secret?” Jason asked.
</div><div>“That is the secret,” Ava replied.
</div><div>“It’s just the fact that you never unleashed your powers after the Hell Angel attempted to take you over,” Ava 
</div><div>continued. Confused, Jason asked what a Hell Angel is and somehow he turned back into that transparent 
</div><div>monster he once was.
</div><div>“See! Hell Angel!” Ava replied.
</div><div>“You just need to think about your father for a small while and he’ll give you power, and your mother was from a
